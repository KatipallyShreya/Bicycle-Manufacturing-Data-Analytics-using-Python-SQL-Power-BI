# Bicycle-Manufacturing-Data-Analytics-using-Python-SQL-Power-BI
**Project Overview**
This project presents a focused analysis of the Manufacturing and Inventory operations from the AdventureWorks database â€” a sample ERP dataset representing a fictional bicycle manufacturing company. Using data extracted from SQL Server, the analysis explores key trends in production flow, stock management, and material handling. An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize performance metrics and operational insights. While the database includes modules for Sales, HR, and Purchasing, this project specifically targets the efficiency, movement, and availability of manufactured goods and inventory within the business process.
